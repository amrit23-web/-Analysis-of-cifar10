CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Deep Learning
This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify CIFAR-10 images into 10 different categories. The model utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNN) implemented using TensorFlow framework. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with each image belonging to one of the following classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

Project Structure
data: This directory contains the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset is automatically loaded using TensorFlow's cifar10 module.
model_training.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for preprocessing the dataset, building the CNN model, training the model on the training data, and evaluating its performance on the test data.
